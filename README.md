Explore the components of a [STAC catalog](https://stacspec.org/en), and create one from scratch using subsets of of SNAP's CF-compliant data.

You will need an environment with `pystac` installed.

Unzip `cmip6_subsets.zip` and replace the filepaths in the bottom section of the `datacube_to_STAC.ipynb` notebook with your local filepaths. Run the notebook and investigate the outputs. Alternatively, just view the outputs here in the `/stac` and `/cmip6_stac` directories.
